1. websocket is a protocol.
2. it is enitrely different form HTTP protocol.
4. difference is :
    a. in HTTP protocol we stablish a connection from clint to the server, and whenever the client needs something from the server, it would make a req to the server
        which would send a response back the client. There was no way that the server would make a connection to the client and send something on its own.
    
    b. in websocket protocol, we have a full-duplec communication, which simply means we that we stablish a connection from client to the server and back from server to the client,
        and it can stay connected as long as it needs to. we have a persistent connection.

    c. websocket protocol is really helpful in building something like real time chat applications beacuse :
        * suppose USER_1 sends a text to the server to send send the same text to 3 other users, in HTTP it would not be possible USER_1 can make the req to the server but the other 
            cannot recieve the text as using HTTP the server will not send anything on its own, but if we use websocket protocol , all the other users will recieve the texts,
            as websockets stablish a 2 way connection meaning the server can send the response on its own.

5. we can use 'socket.io' npm package to add support for websocket in our app.
