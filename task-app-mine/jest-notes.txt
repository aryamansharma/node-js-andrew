1. we can use multiple npm packages for testing our node js application. for eg : Jest, mochajs, etc. 
    choosing which package to use for unit testing is a personal preference.
2. in this project we will be using jest.
3. all the packages we need to use for testing our app should be installed as a dev dependency.
4. we create separate folder for writing test cases in our project. folder name can be anything
5. that folder will contain all the files for test cases.
6. each file should contain 'test.js' extension because that is how jest is going to verify that this file contaisn the test cases,
    and it will run those test cases.
7. each file contains 'test' method which is automatically provided by jest.
9. writing a test case - 
    test('<NAME OF THE TEST CASE',() => {
        // callback to run for this case.

        // if this callback throw an error meaning the test case failed, if not than that means this test case
        // is passed.

    });
10. we need to add a script for using jest in our app, in the "scripts" property in package.json file like this - 
    "test": "jest".

    * then for running jest for running test cases we need to run "npm run test" command in the terminal.
11. jest is a zero configuration testing framework, meaning it has almost everything configured already, 
    we can just pass some additional options.
